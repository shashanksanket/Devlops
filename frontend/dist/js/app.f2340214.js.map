Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img class=\"img-fluid w-100\" src=\"${require('@/assets/images/pages/kb-image.jpg')}\"></p></p><h5>Houston</h5><p>that may have seemed like a very long final phase.

What is that, exactly? A lot of people confuse working titles with topics. Let\\'s clear that Topics are very general and could yield several different blog posts. Think \"raising healthy kids,\" or \"kitchen storage.\" A writer might look at either of those topics and choose to take them in very, very different directions.A working title, on the other hand, is very specific and guides the creation of a single blog post. For example, from the topic \"raising healthy kids,\" you could derive the following working title See how different and specific each of those is? That\\'s what makes them working titles, instead of overarching topics.</p><h4>Unprecedented Challenge</h4><ul class=\"mb-2\"><li>Preliminary thinking systems</li><li>Bandwidth efficient</li><li>Green space</li><li>Social impact</li><li>Thought partnership</li><li>Fully ethical life</li></ul>  ',\n      comments: 19100,\n      bookmarked: 139,\n      UserComment: [\n        {\n          avatar: require('@/assets/images/portrait/small/avatar-s-6.jpg'),\n          fullName: 'Willie Clark',\n          comment:\n            'Based in London, Uncode is a blog by Willie Clark.
